## 📈 Progression
**Method:** polarized progression
- Duration of long runs increases by 10% each week until week 10.
- Strength sets increase from 3 to 4 in final weeks of each phase.

## 🧘 Deload
**Weeks:** 7  
**Strategy:** -30–50% volume, maintain technique

## ⚠️ Safety
- Ensure proper form to avoid injury, especially on compound lifts.
- Watch for fatigue signs during endurance sessions.

## 🗒️ Notes
- Focus on joint mobility and flexibility throughout the training.

## 🍌 Fueling Guidance
- **Day 3 – Conditioning**: Consume carbs 30-60 minutes pre-run, protein within 30 mins post-run.
