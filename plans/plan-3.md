## 📈 Progression
**Method:** double-progression
- Increase weight or reps while maintaining technique.
- Aim for 2–3 reps at **RIR=2** before progressing.
- Deload if you can't complete two sessions at the same load.

## 🧘 Deload
**Weeks:** 9  
**Strategy:** -30–50% volume during deload week, maintain technique

## ⚠️ Safety
- Monitor blood sugar pre/post workouts.
- Avoid heavy lifting if blood sugar **<120 mg/dL**.

## 🗒️ Notes
- Focus on joint mobility and flexibility throughout the training.

## 🍌 Fueling Guidance
- **Day 1 – Lower A:** Protein + carbs within 30 min post-workout.
- **Day 2 – Upper A:** Include healthy fats + protein in meals after session.
