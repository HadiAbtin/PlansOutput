## 📈 Progression
**Method:** double-progression
- Increase weights when achieving upper rep range for 2 consecutive sessions.
- Reduce weights by 10% if unable to achieve reps for 2 consecutive sessions.
- Deload if performance declines across 2 sessions.

## 🧘 Deload
Weeks: 6  
Strategy: -50% volume, maintain technique.

## ⚠️ Safety
- Ensure proper form on all lifts, avoid excessive load on deadlifts.

## 🗒️ Notes
Prioritize mobility work after strength sessions, focus on form.

## 🍌 Fueling Guidance
- **Day 1 – Upper A**: Have protein and carbs within 2 hours after the session.
- **Day 2 – Lower A**: Carb-load prior to session for energy.
